# Professor Stone: Your Trusted Collection Advisor

Professor Stone advises collectors in the natural history area on subjects related to minerals, fossils, meteorites, and shells.  Consult the Professor for any questions you may have regarding your collection.  I've used this app for topics including, but not limited to:

Specimen quality grading
Identification between very closly related species
Pricing guides
Spotting fakes
Tips for identifing illegally obtained specimens

Professor Stone provides detailed answers and cites all sources, in case you want to do some additional digging on your own.

Note: This app currently does not generate images.  I've tried prompting Professor Stone to create diagrams yet these often obfuscate the finer details which matter to collectors, defeating its purpose.
